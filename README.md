# Teaching Philosophy

## Opening Statement

In a 1983 essay, Paulo Freire writes:

> “Reading the world precedes reading the word, and the subsequent reading of the word cannot dispense with continually reading the world. Language and reality are dynamically intertwined.”  
> — *The Importance of the Act of Reading*

My philosophy is that learning and education are not abstract concepts separated from everyday life. Instead, everyday life fuels, ignites, then propels learning and education.

Freire posits that education and reality are forever linked, and this relationship should remain active and progressive. The better study a student is in his or her experiences and observations, the better study that student will be in classical education.

## Beliefs About Learning

This is especially true for information technology practitioners. If Freire’s statement held true in 1983, where there was no public internet, no Computer Fraud and Abuse Act passed, no smartphone or social media, it certainly holds true today where agentic AI has increased the fluctuations in the field and challenged fundamental security standards across organizations.

Education must remain connected to what is happening in the world. Learning that is detached from reality becomes theoretical in a way that weakens application. Students must learn to observe the environment around them, to recognize problems, and to connect technical knowledge to lived experience.

Before learning a new technology, a new coding language, or a new way to apply code, one must understand the problem and the people affected by that problem. This applies to students as well.

## Instructional Approach

As an information security engineer and professor, I believe I must observe the technical world. I must observe companies in my field, including competitors and allies. I must watch nation states and threat actors. I must stay abreast of updates in tactics, techniques, and procedures, along with evolving jargon and methodologies.

Instruction should reflect this active awareness. Students should understand that the field is dynamic and that staying informed is part of professional responsibility. The classroom should reflect the real environment in which security practitioners operate.

## Workforce and Responsibility

At the end of the day, we are servant leaders. We are placed in positions to determine what organizations need. Organizations consist of people whose success is tied to their projects, their daily tasks, their teams, and their institutions. When those fail, families and households feel the effects.

Students must understand that technical work carries consequences. The systems they protect serve real people. Their diligence or negligence impacts more than metrics.

Education cannot be arbitrary. It must be intentional. We may not always know the end from the beginning, yet we must approach learning with purpose and awareness. All knowledge carries potential, and that potential carries responsibility.

## Closing

Learning requires awareness of the world, disciplined observation, and an understanding of human need. Technical education must remain connected to reality, to responsibility, and to service. This is the foundation upon which I approach teaching information technology and information security.
